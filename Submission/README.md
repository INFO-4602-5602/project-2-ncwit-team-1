<br></br>Team member:  Keke Wu, Wei Miao, Xu Han, Yawen Zhang, Jiawei Liu


**Brief description of our project(What):**
<br></br>
This project explores the National Center for Women in Technology(NCWIT) dataset. All of our four visualizations focus on comparisons between female and male from different aspects: time, enrollment number, graduated number, drop-out(left institution) number, major declaration time and race distribution.
<br></br>

**Brief description of Visualization 1:**
<br></br>
* What does it show: The Ratio of Female to Male in Enrollment, Graduated and Dropout Count with Years
* Interactions part: Checkbox showing ratio in Enrollment and/or Graduated and/or Dropout count; Mouseover showing hoverline over different years with Ratio values
* Conclusions: 
<br>The ratio of female/male in Enrollment and Graduated are higher than Dropout, indicating less female per male dropout during school years. </br>

**Brief description of Visualization 2:**
<br></br>
* What does it show:
* Interactions part:
* Conclusions:
<br></br>

**Brief description of Visualization 3:**
<br></br>
* What does it show: The Enrollment Count with Major Declaration Time of Female and Male
* Interactions part:  Checkbox showing Male and Female charts;
                      Mouseover getting tooltips of amount and percentage;
                      Legend filtering data
* Conclusions:
<br>Enrollment trend is almost the same between male and female students.</br>
<br>Enrollment count decreases as time goes by.</br>

**Brief description of Visualization 4:**
<br></br>
* What does it show:
* Interactions part:
* Conclusions:
